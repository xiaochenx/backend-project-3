# backend-project-3

Project Overview
The idea of this app is to allow people to keep track of meaningful and useful gift ideas they have for their loved ones, so they don't just pick up some useless tchotchkes in a gas station on the big day.

How to use

1. Fork and clone this repo to your local machine
2. cd into the "backend" folder and run "bundle install" to install all the gems.
   Then, run "shotgun --port=9393" to start the backend server.
3. Thirdly, fork and clone this frontend to your local environment at https://github.com/xiaochenx/frontend-project-3
4. cd into "gift_tracker" folder, then run "npm install", "npm install react_router-dom", and finally "npm start" to load up the react frontend in your browser.
5. Feel free to explore!

Thank you!
